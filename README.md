# The Premise
## Context
Blind children typically suffer with lower sense of individuality and discovery due to the movement restriction and fear their impairment instills. This discouragement noticeably delays their learning process and causes an over-reliance on their parents. 

## Our proposed solution
Our group proposes an interactive robot toy to help blind children 3-6 years old associate touch with basic objects in their household. The robot toy will contain an a series of braille symbols relating to an object they are searching for. On a mapped out (with tape) matt, the robot will search for the color which corresponds to the object. Once it finds the object the robot will sound the alarm, and the user (blind hcild) will attempt to locate it. While the robot is moving it will emit sound to guide the child in the direction of movement. This interactive game will hopefully improve auditory and touch senses, introduce braille toddlers, increase sense individualism and exploration. This should hopefully reduce some of the learning delays caused by their impairments.
