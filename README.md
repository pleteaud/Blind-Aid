# Blind-Aid

# The Premise
## Context
Blind children typically suffer with lower sense of individuality and discovery due to the movement restriction and fear their impairment instills. This discouragement noticeably delays their learning process and causes an over-reliance on their parents. 

## Our proposed solution
Our group proposes a game to boost blind children's sense of individualism and exploration. In the game, the child is tasked with following a robotic vehicle to a distinct spot on a special mat using their sense of sound. Once the child succesfully navigates to the robot, they will be tasked with identifying the object placed at the special location on the mat using their sense of touch. This game aims to introduce the braille system (found on buttons) to visually impaired children, improve their sense of hearing and touch, and increase their sense of individualism and exploration. We hope this will reduce some of the learning delays caused by their impairments. 

## Final Design
The game matt was designed as a circle with six embedded rhombi all permiterized by a colored tape (red, blue, and green). An item will be placed on each of the rhombi.

On the surface of the robotic vehicle are the Sparkfun Redboard, breadboard, battery, and buttons (with patterns on top of it). Using the Piezo speaker (to make sound) and TCS230 Detector (to parse the tape colors), the vehicle will manuever around the matt searching for the rhombic space corresponding to the selected button. Once the space is found, the robot will stop and make one final sound for the user.
