# The Premise
## Context
Blind children typically suffer with lower sense of individuality and discovery due to the movement restriction and fear their impairment instills. This discouragement noticeably delays their learning process and causes an over-reliance on their parents. 

## Our proposed solution
Our group proposes a robot toy to help blind children 3-6 years old associate touch with basic objects in their household. The game will to encourage individual discovery. Our goAn increase in individualism and exploration would help cutback on the learning delays caused by their impairments.   


that aimed at encouraging blind children of the age 3 to 6  to embrace individual discovery, associate sound with location, and associate braille with an object and the touch sensation of that object. The largest goal of this robot is to increase blind toddlers' desire to discover, and give them a chance to explore things individually.
